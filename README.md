# vue-tailwind-ui

My first attempt at creating a ui library GithubPackage.
It is built using Vue (and soon tailwindcss), but is not working yet.
So far I'm just figuring out how to set everything up.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Compiles and exports library/package
```
npm run build-lib
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
